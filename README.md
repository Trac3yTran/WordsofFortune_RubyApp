If the letter they call  is not there, or if the letter has been called already in this round or unsuccessfully try to solve the puzzle will go to the next player. Each user will have a scoreboard that shows their score if they have correctly guess the letter of solving the puzzle.

 -  Each user spins the win to determine the dollar value and guess a consonant/letter. Calling the correct letters will earn the amount, and the right reveal, multiplied by the number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. They can also buy a vowel for $250 to attempt to solve the puzzle and can continue to buy the vowel if they have the money to do so. Prizes range from $50 - $5000 and others that need to be avoided like Lose a Turn and bankrupt, which automatically go to the next user.
